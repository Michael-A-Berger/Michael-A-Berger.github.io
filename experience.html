			<h1>Job Experience</h1>
			
			<h2><a href="https://www.lenel.com/">Lenel Systems International</a></h2>
			
			<p>My most recent co-op. I worked with Typescript and Lenel's own OnGuard monitoring and video alarm 
			systems to help develop a web video client capable of grabbing footage from a recorder and displaying
			it within seconds. My time at Lenel also spurred my personal growth, giving me the courage to engage
			with my coworkers outside of the office.</p>
			
			<h2><a href="http://www.omegatmm.com/">Omega by Parlec</a></h2>
			
			<p>My first co-operative working experience. I worked on creating fixes and developing features
			for P7, Omega by Parlec's custom machine shop tool program. I learned about the View-Presenter
			Model and Modular Programming design patterns while working in an Agile development environment.</p>
			
			<h2><a href="http://www.fourdirectionsproductions.com/">Four Directions Productions</a></h2>
			
			<p>During the Summers while I was attending high school, I worked for Four Directions
			Productions, the Oneida Indian Nation's video and animation production house. While
			there I was teamed up with the company's tech guru Ryan Rogers and learned about production
			pipelines, differential data backup, and UML architecture.</p>
			
			<h2><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bimbo+Bakeries+USA+Canastota+NY">Bimbo Bakeries USA</a></h2>
			
			<p>In the Summer of 2016, I took a seasonal full-time job at the Bimbo Bakeries USA warehouse
			in Canastota, New York. I was a warehouse order picker, which meant that I picked, stored, and
			stacked bread products that were to be shipped to retailers the following day. It was certainly
			a difficult job, but I persevered and learned valuable lessons about hard work.</p>
